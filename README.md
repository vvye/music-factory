# Music Factory
- Made for the [OLC CodeJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2020)

*Music Factory* is a simple browser game where you build a music machine. Place pipes and instruments on the board and
watch as the balls make a song come to life! Play around with the number of ball generators and instruments until you
find a soundscape you like.

It's also the first real game (that deserves the name) that I made from scratch, so that's something. I wrote it in
JavaScript using the [p5.js](https://www.p5js.org) library.

*Music Factory* is heavily inspired by *[La Pâte à Son](https://jayisgames.com/review/la-pate-a-son.php)*, a browser
game from the 2000s that I used to play a lot as a kid. There doesn't seem to be a playable version of it on the
internet anymore, so you'll just have to believe me when I say it was great fun.

*La Pâte à Son* was quite a bit more advanced than *Music Factory* is (more instruments, more notes, more settings to
tweak, etc.). I guess this is more of a proof of concept, or a minimum viable product? Still, considering it was made
in a week for a jam, I'm pretty happy with it.
